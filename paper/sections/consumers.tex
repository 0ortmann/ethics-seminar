\section{Daring to Consume}

consuming anon trading -- what can I expect the vendor to behave like?
\begin{itemize}
    \item no legal liability -> no justice. paid but got no goods? happens..
    \item silkroad/deep web -> is just without justice enforcing 3rd party
    \item vendor reputation and trust in other peoples reports
    \item assuming ethical attitudes -> the business I am dealing with has to somehow deal with this. assume it is interested in shareholders? stakeholders? stakeholders it feels like! why? 
\end{itemize}
