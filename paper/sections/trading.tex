\section{Anonymous Online Trading}
\label{trading}

Trading goods involves at least two entities. Think of them as vendor and consumer. They could again consist of more than one entity, but for simplicity reasons, vendor and consumer are each treated as one entity. More entities are involved, if the traders use trading platforms or payment providers. In the case of online trading, not only the direct participants have to be considered, but also for example the internet service providers (ISPs) or trading platform operators. Governments are also involved to some extent, as both -- vendor and consumer -- could live in countries where some regulations on trading are set up.
This section will elaborate on the question, what it means for a consumer or a vendor to be anonymous. The consequences for other holders of interest are discussed. The focus is set on deep web markets.

\subsection{Anonymous Entities}

Each entity involved in a trading process could be anonymous. In the context of black markets on the internet, such as silkroad\cite{silkroad2013}, there are three anonymous parties involved during trade: the vendor, the consumer and the platform operator. Any of which has different interests in keeping up the anonymity. In the first place, being anonymous means being private. From a consumers perspective, anonymity is good for acting in secrecy. People who are embarrassed about some products, for example erotics, may seek anonymous market places to buy them.

As soon as illegal goods or services are involved, anonymity gets a different level of importance. Staying anonymous brings some level of safety. Safety from prosecution or law enforcement on the one hand, and safety from other competing sellers on the other. The success of deep web markets is thus mainly influenced by the ability to trade anonymously online.


\subsection{Trusting the Anonymity}

One of the biggest challenges for anonymous online trading is to keep up the anonymity throughout the whole trading process. A lot weak spots in the communication infrastructure have to be considered; the anonymous online communication itself, transferring money between entities and, most often, exchanging material commodities over some geographical distance. Many steps in the process can leak a traders real identity.

In order for businesses to succeed, the involved entities have to trust either each other or in the trading process itself. Trust is a very important driver for internet trading success\cite{internetTrust2004}.

Deep web platforms like silkroad\cite{silkroad2013} combine many technologies to enable anonymity for all involved parties. Trust in generally available technologies is something that the platform operators do not have to build up themselves. By using trustworthy technologies, one can accomplish at least some level of trustworthiness, in terms of communication security. Many deep web stores use the Tor network\footnote{\url{https://www.torproject.org}} to facilitate anonymous connections for all entities\cite{silkroad2013}. The most commonly used payment method is some cryptocurrency exchange, for example Bitcoin. On silkroad, even the prices for the products were directly displayed in Bitcoin\cite{silkroad2013}.

But trust in technology is not everything that is required for anonymous trading to be successful. Section~\ref{consumers} discusses trust among the anonymous traders in detail.

\subsection{Effects of Anonymity during Trade}
% Warum könnte das schlecht sein? Aus wessen sicht?

%Anonymität als driver für Kriminalität, weil strafverfolgung nicht zu befürchten ist.
%-> ganz andere handels ziele
% Regulierung ist auch schutz. der fällt nun auch weg. könnte das trotzdem reguliert sein?

%Warum könnte das gut sein, aus wessen sicht?
% Anonymität als driver für vielfältigkeit. Diversity is nice to have. anonymity enables diversity. accountability disables it! paper cite
% sicherheit der trader vor einander und vor driteen: man braucht keine angst haben, (körperlich) abgezogen zu werden bei irgendwelchen shady deals. sicherheit vor strafverfolgung.
% vorteile der anonymität an sich: zb peinliche waren (nicht unbedingt illegale waren!), erotik

% allgemein, beide sichten betreffend: ganz andere waren werden ausgetauscht - gov findet das doof, alle anderen voll gut. silkroad examples

% ein effect: anon = lower trust in other entities, weil man das nicht kontrollieren kann und auch sonst keiner über einen wacht. -> übergang consumer ethics.
