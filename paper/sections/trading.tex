\section{Anonymous Trading}

Different Levels of anonimity, different entities that can be anonymous.

\subsection{Anonymous Entities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anonymous Vendors
    \item Anonymous Consumers
    \item Anonymous Payments
    \item (maybe) anon goods - ( as a thought experiment - buying and selling sth you do not know, where you only know the price. maybe for speculation reasons? (gets to increase value etc..))
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Opportunities of Anonymous Trading}

\begin{itemize}
    \item positive (direct) effects
    \item negative sideeffects (no control possible by design, gov. cannot control, gov. cannot help / enforce law / k√§uferschutz)
    \item Immoral goods
\end{itemize}
