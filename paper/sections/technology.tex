\section{Facilitating Anonymous Trading}
\label{tech}

%FIXME: der satz ist kacke. könnte auch als abschließende worte in das vorherige kapitel
Many different ethical viewpoints have been taken and moral implications and consequences of consumer and seller actions have been discussed.

The following section covers thoughts about offering technology and enabling other entities to trade anonymously on deep web platforms. Knowing what those other entities could do, is it morally justifyable to develop software or host platforms for anonymous trading? Different viewpoints are discussed. Two main perspectives are differentiated. Software developers and their employing businesses on the one hand and anonymous market platform operators on the other hand. Business ethics are discussed for both sides.

\subsection{Software Development}

Many different software tools are combined to enable anonymous trading on platforms like Silk Road. The Tor network is used to disguise connection origins. Cryptocurrencies are used for payments, because they can be exchanged without identity verification. The trading platform itself can be considered a software tool. Another essential tool would be a browser to access the platform. And there are definitely many more building blocks of software being used to make platforms like Silk Road happen.

From all the above mentioned software, only the trading platform is tailored for the deep web. All the other technologies are rather just used. They could as well be used for something completely unrelated to anonymous trading or the deep web. Is it ethical to develop software that could be used for deep web shops? What is with operating a deep web trading platform?
%It depends on what one defines as ethical.

\subsection{Shareholder Theory}

% wie ist es, das zu ermöglichen?
% voll ok (?) because that tech is not only for that purpose(?)
\subsection{Stakeholder Theory}



% Many software used in that context does not necessarily have the single purpose to be used for anonymous trading, but operating a platform does.
